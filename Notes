Notes for Pointers: 

Binary system [0,1]
hexa decimal system [0-F]

memory locations in hexa decimal system in RAM. 
RAM is more accessible, For quick access program load in RAM. 
so all binary files will stored in RAM. when we load program. CPU is machine that computes
ALU 

instruction feed in program counter. then executed, 
1.2 billions second instruction will be executed, so fast it works. 
 




char &y = x (y is just another name for x, its not pointer. its usage tells us this is not talking about address, just a reference of x. because it refers to same box so it contain same letter
		reference is occupying space, its just another name of same variable. 
cout << &x  // output same address
cout << &y// output same address
sometimes references are great, but updation of values can not be done with references, while in link list, or in dynamic memory updatin, we have to use pointers instead of refrences. 
       
       
int can point to to integer, char can point to character, and it also occupying space. approperiate guy pointing to approperiate person. (same team people)


int x;
int *y = new int()  // advantages in POS system. when you have to deal with large customers
After deletion, pointer still points to same location, but nothing sotred in that address. pointer points to NULL then.

*y = NULL
delete(y) also delete it from memory. 
delete (y)  we delete that thing which pointer points to. Now pointer can opint to any random number, for safety purpose we hardcode it to NULL. 

dangling pointer concept.
